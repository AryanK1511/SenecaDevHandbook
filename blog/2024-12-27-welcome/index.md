Hey everyone! Welcome to the first blog on the Seneca Dev Guide website. Iâ€™m thrilled to have you here!

<!-- truncate -->

This guide was created by myself and a fellow Seneca alum to share the knowledge we wish we had when we started. Our goal is to help you get ahead by providing insights we wish we'd known sooner.

Feel free to explore the [Welcome page](/) for more details. And if you're interested, check out our [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/AryanK1511/SenecaDevHandbook) to contribute. Together, we can make this a valuable resource for the Seneca dev community!

Thanks for being here!
