# Welcome to the Seneca Developer Handbook

Welcome to your first lesson! This website does not have an option to switch to light mode. Why, you ask? Well, because real developers don't use light mode.

Jokes apart,

Welcome to the **Seneca Developer Handbook**—an open-source initiative created by former and current students, as well as alumni, of [Seneca Polytechnic](https://www.senecapolytechnic.ca/home.html). This guide is designed to share the knowledge and experiences we’ve gained throughout our journey as software developers. Our goal is to create a comprehensive, one-stop resource for all things related to software development at Seneca Polytechnic.

Although this handbook primarily focuses on software development, it also includes valuable insights for students in IT and engineering programs.

> This website is an independent initiative and is not officially affiliated with Seneca Polytechnic. Our mission is to provide Seneca students with greater exposure to industry trends, help them stay competitive with top universities, and prepare them for success in the job and startup markets.
