When searching for hackathons, aside from Discord communities and Instagram pages, two major resources stand out:

- üåê **[MLH Website](https://mlh.io/seasons/2025/events)**
- üíª **[Devpost](https://devpost.com/hackathons)**

These platforms list a wide variety of hackathons, making it easier for you to find events that suit your interests and schedule.

### Follow Hackathon Social Media Pages

Another great way to stay informed about upcoming hackathons is by following the social media pages of various hackathon organizers. They often share updates not only about their own events but also about others in the community. Here are some LinkedIn pages to follow:

- [UofTHacks LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/uoftorontohacks/)
- [HackWestern LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hack-western/posts/?feedView=all)
- [HackTheNorth LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hack-the-north/posts/?feedView=all)
- [HackThe6ix LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/hackthe6ixofficial/posts/?feedView=all)

I'll continue to add more as I discover them during my doomscrolling sessions! Stay tuned for updates and never miss out on an exciting hackathon opportunity.
