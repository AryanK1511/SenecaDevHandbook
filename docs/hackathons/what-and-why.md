Hey everyone! üëã I appreciate you taking the time to learn about hackathons and why you should participate in them.

From my experience, not many Seneca students attend hackathons, and the only one we have is the annual [Seneca Hackathon](https://www.senecahackathon.com). While it's great for gaining some exposure, it doesn't fully capture what a real hackathon for developers feels like.

In this document, you'll discover what a hackathon is and why you should join one. Afterward, you can dive deeper into [how to find hackathons](./best-hackathons.md) and explore the [Best Hackathons](./best-hackathons.md).

## Categorizing Hackathons

Hackathons can be categorized based on several metrics:

### Duration ‚è∞

- **In-Person Hackathons**: Typically last **24** or **36 hours**. You'll stay up over the weekend, building projects with your team. It's intense but incredibly fun!
- **Online Hackathons**: Usually extend to **one month or two**. These are more relaxed and allow you to work at your own pace, though they might not be as exhilarating as the shorter, in-person events.

### Mode of Delivery üíªüè¢

- **In-Person** or **Online**: This one‚Äôs pretty self-explanatory. Choose the mode that best fits your schedule and preference.

### Theme üé®

- **Open-Ended**: Freedom to build anything you want. Perfect if you have a specific project in mind or enjoy exploring diverse ideas.
- **Themed**: Must adhere to specific categories or themes.

    - **Online Hackathons** (like those on Devpost) often require you to use the host‚Äôs tools or platforms as part of the eligibility criteria.
    - **In-Person Hackathons** may have themes and sponsor products, meaning if you incorporate the sponsor's products into your project, you can enter their prize pool.
