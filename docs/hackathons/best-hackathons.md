Welcome to the most exciting page of our Hackathon section! ðŸŽ‰ I've curated a list of the most renowned in-person hackathons that you, as Seneca students, can participate in.

Keep in mind that some hackathons, such as [HackTheNorth](https://hackthenorth.com/) (Canada's largest hackathon, held at the University of Waterloo) and [UofTHacks](https://uofthacks.com/) (Canadaâ€™s first student-run hackathon with some of the best sponsors held at the University of Toronto), can be quite competitive to get into, especially if you donâ€™t have prior hackathon experience.

I recommend gaining more experience before applying to these events. However, don't hesitate to apply, you never know!

A good rule of thumb to gauge a hackathon's credibility is to check if it's sponsored by [MLH](https://mlh.io). If it is, you're in for a great experience! Most hackathons listed below are either 24 or 36 hours long, so now you know what you're signing up for.

The people who helped me create this guide and I have attended most of these events. We can confidently say that you'll gain valuable exposure, learn a lot, and meet some awesome people when you attend any of the hackathons mentioned below.

## Seneca's Hackathon

Seneca's very own hackathon! Unlike the other hackathons on the list, this is a fantastic first-time event. It's more business-focused with less emphasis on hands-on coding and development.

However, I highly recommend everyone to participateâ€”you'll meet lots of awesome people, enjoy great food, and have the chance to win some excellent prize money LOL! Typically, the hackathon lasts for three days: two days online and one day in-person from 9 AM to 5 PM. Please note that the schedule is subject to change.

## Find Online Hackathons

Online hackathons are usually much longer than the typical 24 or 36-hour eventsâ€”they can last for a month or even longer. You'll find hackathons hosted by top companies like FAANG, GitHub, Snowflake, and more. They offer great prizes, and you have the flexibility to build your project at your own pace.
